              I am that one weirdo who likes learning random topics and
              complicated concepts. It had been at the back of my mind that I
              quite enjoyed programming even as I was taking an engineering
              programme in uni. It wasn't until a few weeks into the pandemic
              that I'd begun to make a career out of it.

              I've found my niche in web development. Very much enamoured I am
              with JavaScript. If I could have it as a lover, I would. There's
              so much I can do with it and I just keep getting more surprises
              the longer I use it!

              I'm currently working into mastering (or as close to it as
              possible; no human is omniscient) the MERN stack, as well as
              Redux, GSAP, and Bootstrap/Reactrap along the way. I've made React
              my turf. Have to love Hooks and how I can go wild mixing React and
              ES6+.
